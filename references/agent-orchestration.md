# Agent Orchestration Protocol

This document defines how agents coordinate through the **dispatcher** (`CLAUDE.md`). Agents do NOT communicate directly with each other — the dispatcher handles all routing and chaining.

---

## Overview

The dispatcher is a **reactive multi-router**:

1. **User sends a message** → dispatcher picks the best agent by priority
2. **Agent executes** → returns output to the dispatcher
3. **Dispatcher reads the output** → decides if another agent should be chained
4. **Repeat** until done or max depth reached

Agents help the dispatcher by including **suggestions** in their output when they detect work for other agents.

---

## How Agents Signal the Dispatcher

When an agent detects work that another agent should handle, it includes a section at the end of its output:

```markdown
### Suggested next agent
- **Agent**: {name from agents-registry.md}
- **Reason**: {what needs to be done and why}
- **Context**: {relevant details the next agent would need — note titles, folder paths, specific issues}
```

Multiple suggestions are allowed — list them all. The dispatcher prioritizes and decides which (if any) to invoke.

### Examples

```markdown
### Suggested next agent
- **Agent**: architect
- **Reason**: No area exists for "Personal Finance" — 3 notes were placed in Inbox as fallback
- **Context**: Notes: "Monthly Budget March.md", "Savings Goals.md", "Expense Tracking.md". Suggest creating 02-Areas/Personal Finance/ with sub-folders and MOC.
```

```markdown
### Suggested next agent
- **Agent**: connector
- **Reason**: 5 recently filed notes about "Machine Learning" have no cross-links
- **Context**: Notes in 03-Resources/Technology/ML/. They reference shared concepts (gradient descent, neural networks) but have zero wikilinks between them.

### Suggested next agent
- **Agent**: architect
- **Reason**: MOC for Machine Learning is missing
- **Context**: There are now 8 notes under this topic but no MOC in MOC/ folder.
```

## Dispatcher Decision Logic

After each agent returns, the dispatcher:

1. **Reads the output** — looks for `### Suggested next agent` sections
2. **Consults `agents-registry.md`** — validates the suggested agent exists and is `active`
3. **Checks the call chain** — is this agent already in the chain? Is max depth reached?
4. **Decides**: invoke next agent OR return results to user

The dispatcher can also chain agents **without an explicit suggestion** if the output clearly matches another agent's capabilities (e.g., notes created → Sorter might be needed).

---

## Call Chain Tracking

Every user request has a **call chain** — the ordered list of agents invoked so far.

### Rules

1. **Start**: chain is empty `[]`
2. **After each agent returns**: append its name to the chain (the chain always lists agents already invoked, in order)
3. **Pass the chain**: when invoking the next agent, tell it the chain and its position — `"Call chain so far: [scribe, architect]. You are step 3 of max 3."`
4. **No duplicates**: never invoke the same agent twice in one chain
5. **No circular patterns**: if Agent A suggests Agent B and B is already in the chain, skip
6. **Max depth: 3**: no more than 3 agents per user request
7. **On overflow**: return results to user with a note about what was deferred

### What Happens at Max Depth

If the dispatcher would need a 4th agent, it:
- Returns the current results to the user
- Includes a summary of what was deferred: _"The Connector also detected 5 orphan notes that need linking — you can say 'connect the notes' to handle that."_

## What Agents Should NOT Do

- ❌ **Do NOT reference `Meta/agent-messages.md`** — the shared message board is deprecated
- ❌ **Do NOT edit other agents' prompt/config files** (e.g., `.claude/agents/*.md`) — normal vault notes/MOC edits are still allowed per your responsibilities; all coordination goes through the dispatcher
- ❌ **Do NOT block waiting for another agent** — finish your task and suggest next steps in your output
- ❌ **Do NOT call other agents** — only the dispatcher invokes agents

---

## Migration from Legacy System

If a vault still has the old `Meta/agent-messages.md` file:
- The **Librarian** will rename it to `Meta/agent-messages-DEPRECATED.md` during maintenance
- Agents should ignore this file entirely — all coordination now flows through the dispatcher

---

## Reference Files

- **Agent registry**: `.claude/references/agents-registry.md` — the single source of truth for all agents
- **Agent directory**: `.claude/references/agents.md` — detailed descriptions of each agent's responsibilities
