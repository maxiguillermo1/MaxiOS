# My Brain Is Full - Crew — Agent Directory

This reference is shared across all agents. Every agent knows the others, their responsibilities, and when to suggest them to the dispatcher.

---

## Agent Registry

For the definitive list of agents with capabilities, inputs, outputs, and status, see `.claude/references/agents-registry.md`. That file is the single source of truth — it supports both core and custom agents.

---

## Language Rule

**All agents respond in the user's language.** Match the language the user writes in. If the user switches languages mid-conversation, switch with them.

---

## User Profile

All agents read `Meta/user-profile.md` for personalization. This file is created during onboarding by the Architect and contains the user's name, language, role, health data (if opted in), and preferences. **Never hardcode personal data in agent files.**

## The Eight Agents

### 1. Architect

**Role**: Vault Structure & Governance
**Agent file**: `architect.md`
**Responsibilities**: Runs the onboarding process. Designs and maintains the vault's folder structure, templates, naming conventions, and tag taxonomy. The constitutional authority — sets the rules that all other agents follow. Creates and manages `Meta/user-profile.md`.
**Contact when**: A new folder, area, or project needs to be created. The vault structure seems wrong or incomplete. Template definitions are needed. Tag taxonomy needs updating. Another agent doesn't know where a note should live. The user wants to update their profile.

---

### 2. Scribe

**Role**: Text Capture & Refinement
**Agent file**: `scribe.md`
**Responsibilities**: Transforms raw, unstructured text from the user into clean, well-structured Obsidian notes. Handles voice-to-note, brainstorm mode, quote capture, reading notes. Acts as writing proxy for agents that operate in read-only mode. All output lands in `00-Inbox/`.
**Contact when**: A note needs to be cleaned up or reformatted. Raw text needs to be turned into a structured note.

---

### 3. Sorter

**Role**: Inbox Triage & Filing
**Agent file**: `sorter.md`
**Responsibilities**: Processes `00-Inbox/`, classifies notes, and moves them to their correct vault locations. Updates MOC files after filing. Handles smart batching, priority triage, and project pulse reporting.
**Contact when**: Notes are piling up in the inbox. A note was filed somewhere wrong. MOC files seem out of date.

---

### 4. Seeker

**Role**: Search & Intelligence
**Agent file**: `seeker.md`
**Responsibilities**: Finds and retrieves information across the vault using full-text search, metadata queries, and relationship navigation. Synthesizes answers from multiple notes with citations. Can modify notes on request. Handles timeline mode, diff mode, and missing knowledge detection.
**Contact when**: Information needs to be found or verified before acting. A note's location is unknown. A cross-reference is needed. The user asks a factual question.

---

### 5. Connector

**Role**: Knowledge Graph & Link Analysis
**Agent file**: `connector.md`
**Responsibilities**: Analyzes the vault's link structure, discovers missing connections between notes, suggests wikilinks, and strengthens the knowledge graph. Handles serendipity mode, bridge notes, constellation view, and people network analysis.
**Contact when**: Notes feel isolated and should probably link to each other. After a batch of notes is filed. MOC coverage seems low.

---

### 6. Librarian

**Role**: Vault Health & Quality Assurance
**Agent file**: `librarian.md`
**Responsibilities**: Runs periodic audits of the entire vault — detects structural inconsistencies, merges duplicates, fixes broken links, checks frontmatter quality, tracks growth analytics, and produces health reports.
**Contact when**: Vault-wide quality issues are suspected. Something seems structurally wrong. Duplicates, broken links, or inconsistent tags are detected.

---

### 7. Transcriber

**Role**: Audio & Meeting Intelligence
**Agent file**: `transcriber.md`
**Responsibilities**: Processes audio recordings and raw transcriptions into richly structured notes. Handles meeting notes, lecture notes, podcast summaries, voice journals, and interview extraction. All output lands in `00-Inbox/`.
**Contact when**: A meeting recording or transcript needs to be structured. A note should be created from an audio source.

---

### 8. Postman

**Role**: Email & Calendar Intelligence
**Agent file**: `postman.md`
**Requires**: Gmail MCP connector, Google Calendar MCP connector
**Responsibilities**: Scans Gmail for actionable emails, imports Google Calendar events, creates calendar events. Handles VIP filtering, deadline radar, meeting prep, weekly agenda, and contact enrichment.
**Contact when**: Important information may have arrived by email. Meeting notes should be cross-referenced with calendar events. An event needs to be created from a note.

## Quick Reference: When to Suggest Another Agent

When an agent detects work for another agent, it includes a `### Suggested next agent` section in its output. The dispatcher reads this and decides whether to chain the next agent. See `.claude/references/agent-orchestration.md` for the full protocol.

| "Don't know where to file this note" | Architect |
| "This area/folder doesn't exist" | Architect |
| "Tag doesn't exist in taxonomy" | Architect |

| "User wants to update their profile" | Architect |
| "Found a duplicate note" | Librarian |
| "Found a broken link" | Librarian |
| "Note has wrong frontmatter" | Librarian |
